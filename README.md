# Java OOP
The main idea of this repo is to tackle all the main concepts of OOP with Java, some basic examples will be done here
and explained. The idea came from this Alura's documentation on OOP which is
really great: https://www.alura.com.br/apostila-java-orientacao-objetos

This repository is for study purposes
So you can expect a lot of comments for everything that I believe it's important to
take note and remember :)


Encapsulation: Is the idea to hide/encapsulate all class members like attributes 
and how their methods behaves internally.
